0-main.c: Multiple mains Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.
1-main.c: Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2-largest_number.c: This program prints the largest of three integers.
3-print_remaining_days.c:This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.  Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
